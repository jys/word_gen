We just took the code he gave and made it a bit more usable

## Usage

Install Python2 or Python3 with numpy and click.

Then run:

```
  python mots_2D.py && python mots_2D_2.py
```

Result will be in `outputs/FR.txt` by default.

You can choose the language with ``--lang`` and the encoding with
``--codec``
